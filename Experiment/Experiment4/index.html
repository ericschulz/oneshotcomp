                <p><b>Please read the following instructions carefully: </b></p>
                <br>

                <p>You are a merchant trading plants from different planets. Each plant has different features and the features determine how well the plants sell.
                  In this experiment, it will be your task to <b>reason about how plants will sell on the intergalactic market</b> depending on their features.
                </p>
                <p>To help you make your decision, you will be presented with <b>sales patterns</b>. These sales patterns were collected for plants with particular features on the intergalactic market and <b>show how many plants with that feature were sold on a day.</b></p>
                <p>You will be presented with these sales patterns and have to reason about how well plants with particular features sell in a total of <b>10 Rounds</b>.</p>
                <p>Each round is as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>You are presented sales pattern of a plant. This plant is an offspring between two other plants. Therefore, its sales patterns will look like a combination of two features.</li>
                  <li>You have to reason about how two different patterns might have combined to produce the offspring that you see, i.e. by which rule they combined.</b></li>
                  <li>4 new sales patterns are shown, these are also all offspring patterns but from different plants.</b>.</li>
                  <li>Your task is to <b>reason about which off these offsprings was bred by the same method and thereby was created by a similar way of combining features.</b> .</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Let's see an example round!</p>

                  <p>The blue sales pattern is produced by an offspring between two different plants. It shares both of its parents features.

                  <p>The four sales patterns below have been collected from four different plants throughout the galaxy. One of them shows the sales pattern of a plant that is an offspring between two different plants but was breed using the same method as the offspring above. Therefore, it will show a pattern that is the combination of two different patterns that have been combined by the same rules as for the offspring pattern shown above. It is your task to choose one of the patterns below whose patterns were combined in a similar way as the above offspring's patterns were combined.</p><br>
                  <p>In order to do so, just look at the above offspring's patterns. Try to imagine what kind of two patterns might have produced the sales pattern for this offspring. Afterwards, look at the 4 patterns below and try to assess which of those could have been produced by <b>combining different patterns but using the same rule.</b>Good luck!</p>

                  <p><b>IV.</b>It is your task to choose the one you think has been produced by two different parent's patterns, but using the same breeding method.</p>
                  <p><b>V.</b> Choosing the right pattern on a particular trial means looking at the offsrping pattern above, trying to assess what kind of two patterns this pattern might have been produced and extract the rule by which these two patterns might have interacted. Afterwards, you can assess the 4 patterns below, try to extract their pattern parts and reason about which of these patterns has been produced by the same rule but using different parts. Rules can change from trial to trial!</p>
