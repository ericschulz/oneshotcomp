                <p><b>Please read the following instructions carefully: </b></p>
                <br>

                <p>You are a merchant trading plants from different planets. Each plant has different features and the features determine how well the plants sell.
                  In this experiment, it will be your task to <b>reason about how plants will sell on the intergalactic market</b> depending on their features.
                </p>
                <p>To help you make your decision, you will be presented with <b>sales patterns</b>. These sales patterns were collected for plants with a particular feature on the intergalactic market and <b>show how many plants with that feature were sold on a day.</b></p>
                <p>You will be presented with these sales patterns and have to reason about how well plants with particular features sell in a total of <b>10 Rounds</b>.</p>
                <p>Each round is as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>You are presented sales patterns of two plants (<b>Plant A and Plant B</b>) with different features</b>.</li>
                  <li>Then you are presented the sales pattern for another plant. <b>This plant is an offspring of A and B.</b></li>
                  <li>Two new sales patterns are shown, one for <b>Plant C</b> and one for <b>Plant D</b>.</li>
                  <li>Your task is to <b>reason about how an offspring of Plant C and D would sell on the intergalactic market</b> .</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Let's see an example round!</p>

                   <p>You will always see two different patterns first, one is the sales pattern produced by Plant A (with feature A) and one is the sales pattern produced by Plant B (with feature B).
                    Each sales pattern shows how plants with the feature sell on the intergalactic market. The x-axis marks the time over which a plant was traded and the y-axis shows how many plants were sold.</p>
                    <p>Below you can see how well Plant A (with feature A) and how well Plant B (with feature B) sold.</p>

                  <p>The blue sales pattern is produced by an offspring between Plant A and Plant B. It shares both features, feature A and feature B. Notice how the different features interact and try to think about what is typical about this interaction. This is the MOST important part of being an plant trader, infering by what rules features interact on a given trial.</p><br>

They are not related to the first three plants, but grow on the same planet.</p><br>

                  <p>The four sales patterns below have been collected from four different plants throughout the galaxy. One of them shows the sales pattern of a plant that is the offspring between Plant C and Plant D and therefore has both feature C and feature D. It is your task to choose the sales pattern which you think might have most likely been produced by an offspring between Plant C and Plant D.</p><br>
                  <p>In order to do so, just look at Plant A and Plant B's sales patterns. Then, closely assess how their patterns combined to produce their offspring's sales pattern. This will tell you how different features combine on the current trial. Now, look at the sales pattern of Plant C and Plant D and try to apply the same rule of combination (the rule that combined Plant A and Plant B to produce their offspring) to the two patterns. This will help you to choose the right pattern. Good luck!</p>
